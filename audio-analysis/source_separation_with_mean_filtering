MEDIAN FILTERING METHOD
	source: http://dafx10.iem.at/papers/DerryFitzGerald_DAFx10_P15.pdf

	reverse 
	pipeline: We get two spectrograms (harm/perc) by applying two different masks to the original spectrogram.
		  To get the masks we apply two median filterings to the mixed spectrogram, each one with its own 
		  neighborhood length, defined as (l).

	median 
	filter:	  Percussion/Harmonic enhanced spectrograms can be obtained by substituting each spectrogram bin
		  by the median of its (l) neighbors. If (l) is even, each bin is substituted by the mean of the two
		  middle elements.

	harmonic/percussive
	enhancement: The only element that changes the enhancement to more harmonic or more percussive is (l), thus
		  the neighborhood defines a continuity restriction in such a way that we need to experiment some
		  different values for both enhancement modalities.

	masks:	  Hard masks (conditional greater than that returns 1 or 0);
		  Soft masks (well defined value based on Wiener filtering)

	once we get the masks, we can generate two spectrograms, one from each mask, only by performing element-wise
	multiplication between each mask and the original spectrogram.
